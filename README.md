This is a simple Node application built to respond to different user commands using a variety of APIs.

Available commands:
"my-tweets" - Calls the twitter API and shows the last 20 tweets in the account and when they were created
"spotify-this-song" - Calls the spotify API and shows information about the song following the command
"movie-this" - Reaches out to the OMDB API and looks for the movie following the command
"do-what-it-says" - this reads a command from a text file on the filesystem and runs the command.
