# ohnode

This is a simple Node application built to respond to different user commands using a variety of APIs.

Available commands:
"my-tweets" - Calls the twitter API and shows the last 20 tweets in the account and when they were created
"spotify-this-song" - Calls the spotify API and shows information about the song following the command
"movie-this" - Reaches out to the OMDB API and looks for the movie following the command
"do-what-it-says"

### Packages included

   * [Twitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter)
   * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)
   * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
   * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)



4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
   
   * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
     
     * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.
     
     * Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.

### BONUS

* In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.

* Make sure you append each command you run to the `log.txt` file. 

* Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.
